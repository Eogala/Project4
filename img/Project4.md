Introduction
Before we begin, let's review the tools we'll be using throughout this project.

Linux
Linux is the cornerstone of the LAMP stack, serving as the operating system that underpins the entire infrastructure. As an open-source and highly customizable platform, Linux provides a stable and secure environment for hosting web applications. Its efficiency in handling processes and resources makes it an ideal choice for web servers. In a LAMP stack, Linux coordinates the interaction between Apache (the web server), MySQL (the database), and PHP (the scripting language), ensuring seamless operation and communication between these components. This foundation allows for high performance, flexibility, and scalability, making Linux a crucial element in the successful deployment and management of a LAMP-based WordPress website.

Apache
Apache is a critical component of the LAMP stack, acting as the web server that handles client requests and serves web content. As an open-source and widely used web server software, Apache is known for its reliability, security, and flexibility. In a LAMP stack, Apache processes incoming HTTP requests, fetching and delivering web pages to users' browsers. It also supports various modules that extend its functionality, such as URL redirection, authentication, and load balancing. By efficiently managing web traffic and providing a stable platform for running web applications, Apache ensures that your WordPress website runs smoothly and can handle a large number of concurrent users.

MySQL
MySQL is the database management system within the LAMP stack, responsible for storing and managing the data that powers your web applications. As an open-source relational database, MySQL offers robust performance, scalability, and security. In the context of a LAMP stack, MySQL works closely with PHP to handle data operations such as storing user information, retrieving content, and managing transactions. For a WordPress website, MySQL stores all the content, user data, settings, and other essential information, allowing for dynamic content generation and efficient data retrieval. By ensuring data integrity and providing powerful querying capabilities, MySQL plays a crucial role in maintaining the functionality and performance of a WordPress site on the LAMP stack.

PHP
PHP is the scripting language in the LAMP stack, responsible for generating dynamic web content. As a server-side language, PHP processes code on the web server to create HTML content that is then sent to the user's browser. In the LAMP stack, PHP works in tandem with Apache to handle web requests and interact with the MySQL database to retrieve and manipulate data. For a WordPress website, PHP executes the core logic that powers the site, managing everything from user authentication to content management and plugin functionality. By seamlessly integrating with Apache and MySQL, PHP ensures that your WordPress site is dynamic, interactive, and capable of delivering a rich user experience.

# Instalation of Apache
To install Apache, the following commands was used in your terminal.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
